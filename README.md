## When Adding New Documentation

1. Place new documentation files in the `/docs/` directory
2. Use clear, descriptive filenames (e.g., `tool-name.md`)
3. Follow the established format from existing docs. E.g:
   - Start with a clear title and purpose
   - Include basic syntax
   - Show common usage examples
   - List most-common/relevant options/flags
5. Ensure accuracy of command syntax and options
6. Focus on practical, real-world usage patterns
7. Include both basic and advanced usage examples
8. Offer brief tips or best-practices, if appropriate
